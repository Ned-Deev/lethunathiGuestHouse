Overview of the Website:

This website is designed to provide an easy-to-navigate, visually engaging platform for users. It allows potential customers to explore and book rooms at your location, view a gallery of images, get directions to your address, and contact you directly. Additionally, the site is fully optimized for mobile use, so your customers can book, browse, and interact seamlessly across different devices.

What the Website Will Do:

Smooth Navigation:

Visitors can easily navigate through different sections of the website by clicking on the navigation links. When clicked, these links will smoothly scroll users to the relevant sections on the page.

Booking Form:

Your customers can book rooms directly via a form where they provide details such as their name, email, check-in and check-out dates, and room preference. The form includes validation for unavailable dates to avoid double-booking.

Once submitted, the form will log the booking details in the console and show an alert confirming the booking request.

Interactive Gallery:

The gallery section will show images of your venue, and users can click on any image to view it in a larger format in a lightbox. The gallery is interactive, allowing easy navigation between images.

Interactive Map:

The website includes a Google Maps integration that shows your location. Users can click a button to open your location in Google Maps for easy navigation.

Datepicker for Booking:

A custom datepicker ensures that customers can only select valid check-in and check-out dates. It prevents booking of already reserved dates and ensures users are selecting dates in the future.

How the Website Will Benefit You:

Increased Visibility:

With this website, your business will have an online presence, making it easier for potential customers to find and book rooms. By integrating with Google Maps, your location becomes even more accessible.

Convenience for Customers:

The smooth navigation, interactive gallery, and easy-to-use booking form ensure a seamless experience for your customers. It’s simple for them to explore your offerings and make bookings directly on the website.

Booking Management:

The form captures essential booking details, which you can use to manage reservations efficiently. It also reduces the need for manual processing, automating the booking process.

No Cost to Host:

The website is hosted on GitHub Pages, which is free of charge. This makes the hosting solution cost-effective while still providing the reliability and scalability you need to run your site.

How Much You Will Pay (in Rands) to Host:

GitHub Pages is free: Hosting your website on GitHub Pages doesn't require any monthly payment. It’s completely free to use.

Custom Domain Costs (Optional): If you choose to use a custom domain (like www.yourwebsite.com), you will need to purchase the domain name from a domain registrar (e.g., GoDaddy, Namecheap, or Google Domains). The cost of a domain typically ranges from R100 to R500 per year, depending on the domain extension and registrar.

Why It's Free: GitHub Pages offers free static website hosting with no advertisements, unlimited bandwidth, and reliable uptime, making it an excellent choice for small to medium-sized websites.

How to Use the Website:

Update Content:

Whenever you need to make changes to the website (like adding new rooms, updating images, or changing booking information), you can simply update the files on the GitHub repository.

Access the Booking Details:

The booking form currently logs the booking information in the browser console, so you can monitor it. However, we can integrate this with an email service or a database for better management in the future.

Monitor Website Performance:

GitHub Pages ensures your website loads quickly and is always available. Since GitHub automatically manages the hosting infrastructure, you don’t have to worry about server maintenance or uptime issues.

Conclusion:

This website offers a convenient, visually appealing platform for you to attract customers and manage bookings. It's a cost-effective solution, as the website is hosted for free on GitHub Pages. The only potential ongoing cost is purchasing a domain name (optional).

By integrating Google Maps, an interactive gallery, and a booking form, you create a user-friendly experience that will help your customers book rooms more easily. In the long run, the website can increase your business's visibility, streamline the booking process, and potentially lead to more customers.

If you'd like to customize or extend the website further, additional features or integrations can be added at any time. The key benefit of this setup is its simplicity, cost-effectiveness, and ability to grow with your needs.
